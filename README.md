# alu-AirBnB_clone

###Description
A command interpreter to manage our AirBnB objects. The main purpose is to create all classes for AirBnB(User, City, Place...) that inherit from a BaseModel, create a class that takes care of the initialization, serialization and deserialization of instances, an abstracted storage engine, and unit tests to validate all classes and the storage engine.
